### Background
The client is a used car dealership, with an interest in better understanding what is important to a buyer, in order to better inform pricing and promotion.

### The Dataset
The original dataset from Kaggle contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  We seek to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.
### Business Objectives
Since we can't actually interview the client, here are some of the possible business objectives which this effort might achieve.
1. Sell more cars
2. Sell cars more quickly to reduce lot inventory costs and depreciation
3. Increase profit margin on sale
4. Decrease cost of purchase
5. Improve promotion effectiveness by advertising what buyers are looking for.
6. Improve customer satisfaction
7. Improve retention / repeat buyers
8. Increase sales agent productivity / retention

### Business success criteria
Possible metrics and goals associated with each business objective
1. Increase total #cars sold
2. Decrease average time on lot
3. Increase average profit per sale
4. Decrease average purchase price on intake
5. Improve promotional effectiveness (channel dependent metric)
6. Increase post sale customer satisfaction at +1 week, +1 month, +1 year
7. Increase percentage of buyers who repeat
8. Increase average revenue / profit / commission per agent.  Increase average agent tenure

### Data Objectives derived from Business Understanding

1. Determine the relative importance of factors (columns) affecting the prices of used cars in the USA.
2. Examine regional variation.  Develop hypotheses about any subsetting necessary to restrict the training set to increase relevance for this client.
2. Build and test models which can be used to predict the price of additional cars given the named factors.
3. Use the best predictive models to build hypotheses about consumer prefences.
